# youtube_fan_discord.py_bot
This project is a simple Discord bot written in Python to spam your server with videos from your favourite YouTube channel, it doesn't have many features, as it's my first project and I wanted to keep it simple.

## Setup process

* Download the files and in the same folder create a file (.env) inside define DISCORD_TOKEN ='' with the token of your bot and Key ='' with the api youtubev3 key. 
* In the file pbm.py modify the variables ytid =''' and playlistid =''' with the id of the youtube channel and the playlist containing all its videos |  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0[ &list=PLMC9KNkIncKtPzgY-5rmhvj7fax8fdxoj ] | just the part between brackets, get the id of a discord Chanel to put in channel = client.get_channel(id=)
* and lastly install req.txt
